# ConsoleApp1
Activity # 4
Create a console app with a class that has an interface and push it to a git repo! Send me the link to the repository when done. 
Your class should have at least one interface and three different types of properties.
The interface (and therefore, your class) should have at least three out of these four things:
Instance methods, properties, events, indexers.
Make sure you have an instance of this class in main!
